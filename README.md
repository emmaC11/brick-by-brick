# Brick by Brick
Welcome to Brick by Brick! This project is a replica of the popular LEGO website for my final project of my UCD Full-Stack Devlopment course. This project was developed using Django, a powerful web framework for Python, and styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The primary aim of this project is to showcase various features commonly found on e-commerce platforms, with a focus on providing users with an immersive shopping experience in a LEGO-themed environment.

# Design
The design of the brick by brick takes its inspiration from the official [Lego Website](https://www.lego.com/en-ie). Using a minimalistic design approach, the design combines simplicity with functionality. The design aims to mirror the LEGO brand's identity. With a cohesive color scheme and user-friendly layout, the website ensures seamless navigation, inviting users to explore products.

## Colour Scheme
The website uses a primary colour palette. The primary colours used throughout the website are yellow (#ffcf00), orange (#FD8024), deep purple (#201D48F) & blue. The site uses the same primary colours throughout to keep design consistent and clean.

## Wireframes
I decided to take a different approach to wireframes for this project as my aim was to follow a design that already exists & was designed by professionals. I took screenshots of each page I wanted to include & using the draw functionality on my computer, I marked the sections I wanted to include in my project & used these as a reference. I found this approach really helpful as I could reference images over a simple diagram. These were created before dev started so production site design may vary slightly to wireframes. (please excuse the awful drawing &writing....)
