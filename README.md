# Brick by Brick
Welcome to Brick by Brick! This project is a replica of the popular LEGO website for my final project of my UCD Full-Stack Devlopment course. This project was developed using Django, a powerful web framework for Python, and styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The primary aim of this project is to showcase various features commonly found on e-commerce platforms, with a focus on providing users with an immersive shopping experience in a LEGO-themed environment.

# Design
The design of the brick by brick takes its inspiration from the official [Lego Website](https://www.lego.com/en-ie). Using a minimalistic design approach, the design combines simplicity with functionality. The design aims to mirror the LEGO brand's identity. With a cohesive color scheme and user-friendly layout, the website ensures seamless navigation, inviting users to explore products.

## Colour Scheme
The website uses a primary colour palette. The primary colours used throughout the website are yellow (#ffcf00), orange (#FD8024), deep purple (#201D48F) & blue. The site uses the same primary colours throughout to keep design consistent and clean.

## Wireframes
I decided to take a different approach to wireframes for this project as my aim was to follow a design that already exists & was designed by professionals. I took screenshots of each page I wanted to include & using the draw functionality on my computer, I marked the sections I wanted to include in my project & used these as a reference. I found this approach really helpful as I could reference images over a simple diagram. These were created before dev started so production site design may vary slightly to wireframes. (please excuse the awful drawing &writing....)

# **Testing**
## Validator Testing
* To verify that the HTML code was written to the best standard, I conducted validator testing with the W3C Markup Validator. I fixed the errors and warnings and currently there are no errors or warnings in the HTML code.
![image](https://github.com/emmaC11/Dev-Connect/assets/83119583/bd567c82-4ff4-4199-89b7-2055c0374a8f)

* CSS styling was validated using the W3C CSS Validation Service to ensure the code was written to the expected standard. No errors were found when passing the code through the W3C CSS validator.
![image](https://github.com/emmaC11/Dev-Connect/assets/83119583/10c56d43-9114-46f7-8340-49031808409b)

I have used the PEP8 Linter to validate my code. It is activated within my code editor (Visual Studio Code). I had lots of 'lines too long' & 'whitespace' errors. I split lines where applicable, but I had to use #noqa (meaning line(s) is ignored by linters & validators) in settings.py as these lines could not be split without causing errors. I installed a [VS Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shardulm94.trailing-spaces#:~:text=At%20any%20time%2C%20you%20can,type%20%22Trailing%20Spaces%3A%20Highlight%22) that highlights whitespace within the code. Throughout development I have been making tweaks to my code to ensure there are no errors. There are now no errros in my code. View the PEP8 documentation [here](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)



## add manual tests

## Event Listener Testing
Event listener testing focuses on verifying the functionality and responsiveness of event listeners within a web application.
* All button clicks trigger an event on the site.

## Responsive Testing
* The website was tested on several devices and screen sizes to ensure it was responsvie regardless of the screen size. It has been tested on desktop, Ipad Mini, Ipad Air, Iphone 5, Samsung Galaxy S8+, Iphone X, Iphone SE. Mobile devices have been tested in portrait and landscape mode. The site has been tested in Chrome, Edge, FireFox & Brave browsers.

## Lighthouse Testing
* The Lighthouse tool in Chrome DevTools is used to test a websites performance & accessibility. It is an open-source automated tool used to improve the quality of webpages.
When I tested my website, an audit report was returned indicating that my website has high performance and is accessible. However my accessibility rating is low, due to the white text on my hero image. This is something that will be addressed in next sprint.

## User Testing
The site has been tested regularly during development. After the site was completed I reached out to some fellow students & asks them to test the site & provide feedback.

## Bugs Identified During Development & Testing
* Site would not run locally as I did not have gitpod server in allowed_hosts.
* Heroku deployment was failing as I did add the disable_collectstatic config var
* Missing endblock tags in html template, fixed by adding {%endblock%} tag at end of HTML code.
* Content from base.html was not displaying in index.html as I did not add block content tags to base.html
* Images were not loading as I was not using load static template tag, I used images locally as a temporary fix until I identified the issue.
* Several times I forgot to close loops & if statements, best practise was going line by line to ensure the conditional or loop was closed when required,
* Some of my commit messages have spelling errors, however this is due to an issue with the bash terminal. I type the commit message correctly however it is changed after I confirm the commit.
![image](https://github.com/emmaC11/Dev-Connect/assets/83119583/a41f9e86-5a3b-4d27-94a5-99dfcc3cd5be)
* Some of my commit messages are way to vague, several commits have comments as I only realise after I complete a git push that several files & lines have been edited. I noticed that as I reached my project deadline my commit messages were becoming shorter & shorter.
* Tailwind css file constantly adding changes automatically, that is why these changes are mentioned in commits.
* Brick-by-brick project name not available in heroku, used brick-by-brickk
* When adding tailwind originally, I followed setup without django, did steps again with django doc and worked as expected, would have been easier if I set up when first starting project.
* Stored tailwind files in lego_main app while tailwind needs to be in separate theme app
* Content not displaying as I was missing block content tags after navigation bar
* Forgot to add .asView at end of views in urls.py causing the path to not work as expected.
* Reverting commits caused me to be behind in main branch.
* Template not rendering as product defined as legoSet in view not legoset, which was in template,
Legoorderitems not items in related name

* PAYPAL scripts not rendering as I did not load script tags in base.html
