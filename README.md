# Brick by Brick
Welcome to Brick by Brick! This project is a replica of the popular LEGO website for my final project of my UCD Full-Stack Devlopment course. This project was developed using Django, a powerful web framework for Python, and styled with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. The primary aim of this project is to showcase various features commonly found on e-commerce platforms, with a focus on providing users with an immersive shopping experience in a LEGO-themed environment.
